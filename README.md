# Data Science Exam Project - Basketball NCAA Analysis
All reports are in Italian.

The complete report is generated from **Prosa-Gabriele-Dominci-RMD.Rmd** and the slides presentation from **Presentazione-Gabriele-Dominici-SLIDES.Rmd**.

I used a dataset about Basketball NCAA, found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-womens-tournament/overview), and I made some analysis.
